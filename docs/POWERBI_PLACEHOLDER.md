# PBIX placeholder

This repository contains the Power BI report assets (queries, DAX samples, and example visuals). Due to file size and binary format, the actual Power BI Desktop file (.pbix) is not included here.

To add your .pbix file to the repository, you can do one of the following:

- Upload the .pbix as a release asset in GitHub Releases and link it from this README.
- Add the .pbix to a storage location (Azure Blob, OneDrive, Google Drive) and add a link here.
- If you must include a .pbix in the repo, add it to a dedicated folder (e.g., /pbix/) and commit it; be aware of GitHub file size limits (100 MB recommended limit).

Recommended filename: `Clothing_Customer_Behavior_Report.pbix`

Once you upload the .pbix, update the main README to link to the file or Release.
